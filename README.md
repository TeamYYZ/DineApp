## Short description of your app
Get a lunch buddy in minutes with the “Dine” app
Planning a meal? See your friends’ location and know when will everyone show up
can’t decide where to go? Vote for it
## Required (core) user stories for your app in a bulleted list
User can sign in using social media account / or create new Dine account
User can browse nearby dine requests by map view or list view(categorised by restaurant name/ distance)
User can choose to join a request, and send out the arrival time and meet-up location
User can create a request(time and restaurant) and post it
User can create party group(restaurant, location, scheduled time will be visible to all group members), group members would get notifications from group owner in case there’s any changes
Group owner can see group members’ location if the user allows it
Group owner can start a voting on restaurant candidates, group members can vote
As a user, I have a friend list  and can add friends by searching their accounts 
As a user, I have a block list, such that every dining request I initiated will not be visible to him/her, and I will receive a notification if he/she enters the dining group that I am currently in.
As a user, I can create a private dining group and send invitation to selected friends and the dining request is invisible to any others.  
The app can tell user the direction to the chosen restuarant
The user can know how much money each needs to pay and tips as well

## Optional (nice to have) user stories listed separately
chat room for party group
user credibility system(if a user accept a request and never shows up, the credibility will decrease)
private message system
